        "  - Navigate the software using its GUI\n",
        "    - user interface makes sense for the most part, relatively intuitive.\n",
        "    - I will note that I am still getting used to where all the components are, and my wires get crossed a bit. For a while there I would go to the layout tab or the imagry tab to look for the north arrow and the like. Also, the symbology tab was not there at first, and it took some futzing around for me to figure out how to open it."
